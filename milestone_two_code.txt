Step 7 – Scatterplots and Correlation

1.	For at least one pair of quantitative columns/variables:
	
	a.	Plot a scatterplot of the data in the two columns/variables.

		> plot(prices$low, xlab = "Index Number (From 1 to 851,264)", ylab = "Stock Price", main = "Scatter Plot of Stock Price Lows")
		> plot(prices$high, xlab = "Index Number (From 1 to 851,264)", ylab = "Stock Price", main = "Scatter Plot of Stock Price Highs")

	b.	Compute the correlation between the columns/variables.

		> cor(prices$low, prices$high)
		[1] 0.9998925

	c.	Add the scatterplot and correlation to your webpage.

		https://sites.google.com/view/tgreaves-mat327-fa20/milestones/milestones-two

	d.	Add a few sentences on your webpage interpreting the scatterplot and correlation (ex. how closely are the two variables related? If there is a relationship, does it appear linear?)

2.	Add your R code for this milestone to your GitHub account.


Step 8 – Confidence Intervals

1.	Choose at least 2 quantitative columns, and do the following for each column:

	a.	Compute the 95% confidence interval for the mean.

		'low' from 'prices.csv'
		> xbar = mean(prices$low)
		> xbar
		[1] 70.11841

		> s = sd(prices$low)
		> s
		[1] 82.87729

		> n = 851264
		> n
		[1] 851264

		> t = qt(0.975, 851264-1)
		> t
		[1] 1.959967

		> L = xbar - t*s/sqrt(n)
		> L
		*[1] 69.94236*

		> U = xbar + t*s/sqrt(n)
		> U
		*[1] 70.29447*

		
		'high' from 'prices.csv'
		> xbar = mean(prices$high)
		> xbar
		[1] 71.54348

		> s = sd(prices$high)
		> s
		[1] 84.4655

		> n = 851264
		> n
		[1] 851264

		> t = qt(0.975, 851264-1)
		> t
		[1] 1.959967

		> L = xbar - t*s/sqrt(n)
		> L
		*[1] 71.36405*

		> U = xbar + t*s/sqrt(n)
		> U
		*[1] 71.72291*


	b.	Add the confidence intervals to your webpage (can be near the previously computed means).

	c.	Add a few sentences on your webpage interpreting the confidence intervals (ex. are the confidence intervals large or small? How much should we trust our estimates of the means?)

2.	Add your R code for this milestone to your GitHub account.
